# minesweeper

This is a minesweeper game developed in Rust using Bevy, a free and open source data-driven game engine. The development is based on [Bevy Minesweeper: Introduction - DEV Community](https://dev.to/qongzi/bevy-minesweeper-introduction-4l7f) but since the engine is very young and hence under very rapid iterations a lot of APIs have changed since the tutorial (it uses Bevy 0.8 while this repo is with Bevy 0.13). Some additional designs were also added in this repo.

## Usage
```shell
cargo run
```
